            <p>According to folklore, Bhopal was founded in the 11th century by the Paramara king Bhoja, who ruled from
                his capital at Dhar. This theory states that Bhopal was originally known as Bhojpal after a dam (pal)
                constructed by the king's minister.[4] An alternative theory says that the city is named after another
                king called Bhupala (or Bhupal)</p>

            <p>In the early 18th century, Bhopal was a small village in the Gond kingdom. The modern Bhopal city was
                established by Dost Mohammad Khan (1672â€“1728), a Pashtun soldier in the Mughal army.[24] After the death
                of the emperor Aurangzeb, Khan started providing mercenary services to local chieftains in the
                politically unstable Malwa region. In 1709, he took on the lease of Berasia estate and later annexed
                several territories in the region to establish the Bhopal State.[25] Khan received the territory of
                Bhopal from the Gond queen Kamlapati in lieu of payment for mercenary services and usurped her kingdom
                after her death.[26] In the 1720s, he built the Fatehgarh fort in the village, which developed into the
                city of Bhopal over the next few decades.</p>
