                Bhopal is the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and the administrative headquarters of
                both Bhopal district and Bhopal division. It is known as the City of Lakes for its various natural and
                artificial lakes and for being one of the greenest cities in India. It is the 16th largest city in India
                and 131st in the world. After formation of Madhya Pradesh, the state capital Bhopal was a part of the
                Sehore district. It was bifurcated in 1972 and a new district Bhopal was formed. Flourishing around
                1707, the city was the capital of the former Bhopal State, a princely state of the British ruled by the
                Nawabs of Bhopal. Numerous heritage structures from this period include the Taj-ul-Masajid and Taj Mahal
                palace. In 1984, the city was struck by the Bhopal disaster, one of the worst industrial disasters in
                history.

            <p>Bhopal has a strong economic base with numerous large and medium industries operating in and around the
                city. Bhopal is considered as one of the important financial and economic destinations in Madhya
                Pradesh's two strong wealth pillars, the other being Indore. Bhopal's GDP(nominal) was estimated at INR
                30,467 crores (2016-17) by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Madhya Pradesh. A Y-class city,
                Bhopal houses various educational and research institutions and installations of national importance,
                including ISRO's Master Control Facility,[16] BHEL and AMPRI. Bhopal is home to a large number of
                institutes of National Importance in India, namely, IISER, MANIT, SPA, AIIMS, NLIU, IIFM, NIDMP and IIIT
                (currently functioning from a temporary campus inside MANIT). Bhopal city is also the divisional
                headquarter of Bhopal division of west central railways (WCR), whose office is located at Rani Kamlapati
                Railway Station (RKMP), formerly known as Habibganj.

                The city attracted international attention in December 1984 after the Bhopal disaster, when a Union
                Carbide pesticide manufacturing plant (now owned by Dow Chemical Company) leaked a mixture of deadly
                gases composed mainly of methyl isocyanate, leading to one of the worst industrial disasters in the
                world's history. The Bhopal disaster continues to be a part of the socio-political debate and a
                logistical challenge for the people of Bhopal.</p>
